- Seperate permissions of things like crud between types of signed in accounts (admin/user) so only admin can use crud actions, while users can add books to their collections and have other actions.
- Add book to your collection
- Sort by genre
- make sure multiple books of same name are not added to database
- reccomnded reading based on genre
- review section
- search to look if a book is already in system
- to add a status function, if you are reading a book, have read the book, if it is lent out to someone. maybe even how you own it digital, audio, physical
